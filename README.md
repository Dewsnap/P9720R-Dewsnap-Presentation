# P9720R-Presentation

Included in this repository is my presentation (both as a .pptx and .pdf file) on the Chapman function and how it is used to model the ozone layer. Also included are pdfs of the referenced papers from which the derivation and figures are taken.

Chapman 1930 discusses the process in which ozone is regenerated, namely the Chapman cycle. Chapman 1931a discusses the absorption and dissociative/ionizing effect of radiation in the atmosphere. The derivation of the Chapman function and its associated figures included in the presentation are taken from this paper. Chapman 1931b is a direct sequal to Chapman 1931a, and discusses the less-ideal edge cases of grazing incidence where the previous assumptions begin to fail.

Also included are my comments on each of the presenations given, including areas of improvement for my own presentation. The comments are given in the order of the presentations.
